# Photo-Estimator

Ever Wonder whether an image you just took wil get as many views and likes as you think it would , will maybe not but major companies would for their marketing and business,

# Purpose for the app

In this app I use machine learning in order to predict whether an image is good or not ,
the major idea is to check your last images and their correspendant likes and views and use Supervised learning to predict whether your next image will get as many likes or not


# How does it work

I get your past images using a github repo with the link below, and use simple machine learning to predict the likes of ur next image
I managed to turn this regression problem into a classification problem by calculating your average number of likes, making an image with a number of likes below the average therefore not popular "0" and the a pic with likes above the mean average of popular "1" , therefore turning this into a binary classification prolem, and using a convo neural network of course


# Usage
You Run "app.py" which will open is basically a Flask wep app which will open a html page ,then it gets easier and you won't have to worry about anything else because it's working on the backend icluding getting the data,training the model,making the predictions :D

please follow me and give me a job xD
